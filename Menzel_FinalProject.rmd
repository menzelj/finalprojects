# Investigating if copy number variations (CNVs) are
# more frequently associated with early or late replicating regions.

# the following uses bedops tool called closest feature
# will measure distance to closest replication region.

# this will add to each entry in our sorted outcnv.bed file the position
# and distance to the nearest region in the early replication
# file outrepstarts.bed, negative distances are downstream positive upstream and zeros are overlapping
